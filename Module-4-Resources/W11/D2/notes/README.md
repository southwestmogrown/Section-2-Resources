# Getting Started With Sequelize

Starting with a basic server

```js
const express = require("express");
require("dotenv").config();
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const port = process.env.PORT;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${process.env.PORT}...`));
```

Packages needed for set up that we have already seen

- `express`
- `sqlite3`
- `dotenv`

Dev dependencies

- `nodemon` (not necessary, but useful)
- `dotenv-cli` (needed to work with sequelize commands when connecting to DB)

To start off, we have to install a couple packages

- `npm install sequelize`
- `npm install sequelize-cli`

Then we initialize Sequelize

- `npx sequelize init`

This command creates a bunch of folders and files for us

- We will be replacing the entirety of the config.json file
- We will not be touching the models/index.json file. This file bundles up all of the stuff that Sequelize needs and exports it as the db variable.

- The migrations file's job is to make changes to our DB
- Seeders files are filled with our initial DB data
- Model files are class representations of our tables

```js
// ** Create a .sequelizerc file and add to it:
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  config: path.resolve("config", "database.js"),
  "models-path": path.resolve("db", "models"),
  "seeders-path": path.resolve("db", "seeders"),
  "migrations-path": path.resolve("db", "migrations"),
};

// ** Delete everything in the config/database.js file and replace with:
module.exports = {
  development: {
    storage: process.env.DB_FILE, // location of DB file
    dialect: "sqlite", // specify RDBMS
    seederStorage: "sequelize",
    benchmark: true, // prints execution time to terminal
    logQueryParameters: true, // logs SQL query parameters to the terminal
    typeValidation: true, // model-level data type validation
    // logging: false // prints SQL to terminal unless set to false
  },
};
```

- storage: Tells Sequelize where our actual DB is
- dialect: Tells Sequelize which RDBMS we are using
- benchmark: Basically just turns .timer on by default
- logQueryParameters: Allows us to actually see the values when we make changes to our DB
- typeValidation: Helps us enforce data types on our tables
- logging: Defaults to true and prints our SQL to the terminal

## Migrations

- For making changes to the DB structure
- Table names = Capitalized and Plural
  - Table: Users
- CLI commands: \*\* Can add -cli to the sequelize command, but not needed
  - `npx sequelize migration:generate --name <create-name-of-table>`
    - Generate a new migration file
  - `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`
    - Run all migration files that haven't been ran
  - `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate:undo`
    - Rolls back the most recent migration
  - `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate:undo:all`
    - Rolls back all migrations

Important notes

- Anytime we are running a command to interact with our db, we need Sequelize to
  see our environment variables, so we have to add the "dotenv"
- Every migration file we create has 2 parts: an "up" and a "down"
  - The "down" should always directly undo the "up"
- Migrations don't only create/edit our tables, they also act as version control for our DB
- All of our normal conditions like unique or not null are represented as key-value pairs in the column objects

The Sequelize Meta table's job is to track the migration files that have been executed

## Models

- Class representations of each table, with built-in query methods
- Model names = Capitalized and SINGULAR
  - Model: User
- CLI commands:
  - `npx sequelize model:generate --name <name> --attributes <table attributes>`

Important notes

- We do not have to add an "id" attribute. Sequelize will add that for us for models that we generate.
- We will be switching from snake_case to camelCase for our column names
- Make sure that any changes we make to migrations, such as adding constraints, we need to add those changes to the model as well
- Making changes to our model does not mean we need to run any additional commands

## Seeders

- For inserting starter data into tables

- There are 2 types of commands:
  - Commands that create files
  - Commands that interact with the db
    These require us to add "dotenv" to the command

Now that we have created a table, we need to create a seeder file

CLI commands:

- `npx sequelize seed:generate --name <name>`
- `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`
  - Runs all seeders that haven't been ran
- `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:undo`
  - Rolls back the most recent seed file
- `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:undo:all`
  - Rolls back all seeder files

## Important notes

The seeder bulkInsert method tests against table constraints, but not against
the model constraints

queryInterface is an object built into Sequelize and has a ton of built-in methods

One thing that will help you out with Sequelize is envisioning the SQL that
Sequelize will be creating

The seederStorage property in our config/database.js file is what gives us the
SequelizeData file in our DB

Database reset script:

```js
    "dbreset": "npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:undo:all && npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate:undo:all && npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate && npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all"
```

```
    ** Look up Sequelize validators on Google
        https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/validations-and-constraints/#validators
    ** Add some validators to the model
```

If we want our seeders to check against our model validations, we have to take a couple extra steps

We will be utilizing our model's built-in bulkCreate method

```js
// Instead of bulkInsert like below, we will replace with bulkCreate
// Insert into People using queryInterface.bulkInsert:
await queryInterface.bulkInsert(
  "People",
  [
    {
      name: "John Doe",
      isBetaMember: false,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  ],
  {}
);

// First we need to import our model into the seed file:

// Insert into People using Person.bulkCreate:
const { Person } = require("../db/models");

// Then set up a bulkCreate statement

await Person.bulkCreate(
  [
    {
      name: "John Doe",
      isBetaMember: false,
    },
  ],
  { validate: true }
);

// will throw an error from model-validation:
await Person.bulkCreate(
  [
    {
      name: "John Doe",
      isBetaMember: "yes",
    },
  ],
  { validate: true }
);
```

```js
    await <model>.bulkCreate({
        <seeders>
    }, { validate: true })
```

**`bulkCreate` instead of `bulkInsert` is highly recommended**

```
** A statment that has helped some students in the past:
    All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. Everything in our migrations goes into our model, but not everything in our model goes into migrations.
```

If we change an existing migration file, the migration must be rolled back in order for the changes to take effect. This would wipe that table, causing significant loss of user data.

We need to start by creating a new migration file

`npx sequelize migration:generate --name <descriptive name>`
If we set allowNull: false to the new column, we run into an error

We can get around this error by setting a defaultValue property
